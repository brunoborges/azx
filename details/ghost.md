The main point of deploying a blog like this is the simplicity combined with the scalability. There are no VMs to think about and no databases to manage. Ghost is pulled down in a container, which is charged up based on your service plan which you can scale at any time.

Same with MySQL – but it’s managed for you so there’s a lot you don’t need to worry about.
