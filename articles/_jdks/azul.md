# Overview

Azul provides OpenJDK binaries (Zulu) as well as a specialized Java platform (Zing).

## Support Options

Azul offers an option for all companies that do not want to skip all Java SE versions between LTS releases but cannot switch to the newest version every 6 months. Next, to the support for all LTS releases, where Azul provides 1 more year of support than Oracle, Azul offers support for so-called Medium Term Support (MTS) releases for their Zulu JDK. Here you can buy commercial support for every second Java SE version regardless of if it is LTS or not. The support duration of these versions is different. Azul tries to provide a good time range to prepare migration to the next version and defines 3 different durations for support of Java SE versions.

Unlike Oracle, the commercial support of Zulu is not defined per CPU but based on the number of systems. A system is defined as a physical or virtual server. The only difference between standard and premium is the availability of support. By buying premium support you can call Azul 24x7.
